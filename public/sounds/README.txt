AI-Themed Sound Effects for Audio Visualizer
===========================================

Place your AI-themed sound effect files in this directory with the following names:

1. ai-boot.mp3 - AI system startup/boot sound
2. data-process.mp3 - Data processing/computing sound
3. neural-pulse.mp3 - Neural network pulse/activity sound
4. quantum-compute.mp3 - Quantum computing/futuristic sound

Sound Effect Recommendations:
- Duration: 2-5 seconds each
- Format: MP3 (for better browser compatibility)
- Quality: 128-192 kbps is sufficient
- Style: Electronic, synthetic, futuristic

You can find suitable sounds from:
- Freesound.org (Creative Commons sounds)
- Zapsplat.com (free with account)
- Generated using AI sound synthesis tools
- Created with DAWs like Audacity or Logic Pro

For testing purposes, the visualizer will work without these files
using simulated data mode (simulateData={true}).
