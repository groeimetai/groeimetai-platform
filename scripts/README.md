## Usage Examples

### Deploy to Google Cloud Run

```bash
# 1. Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-google-cloud.sh

# 2. Copy service account key to clipboard
./scripts/copy-sa-key.sh gcp-sa-key-groeimetai.json

# 3. Add to GitHub Secrets:
#    - Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
#    - Add GCP_SA_KEY with the clipboard content
#    - Add all other required secrets (see GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md)

# 4. Push to master branch to trigger deployment
git push origin master
```

### Deploy to Mumbai Testnet
```bash
# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys

# Run deployment
./scripts/deploy-blockchain.sh
# Select option 2 for Mumbai

# Verify deployment
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

### Deploy to Local Development
```bash
# Start local blockchain
npm run blockchain:local

# Deploy contracts
npm run deploy:local

# Set up roles
npm run setup:roles
```

### Migrate Existing Certificates
```bash
# Dry run first
npm run migrate:certificates -- --network mumbai --dry-run

# Actual migration
npm run migrate:certificates -- --network mumbai --batch-size 10
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables for scripts:

```bash
# Deployment wallet
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key

# RPC endpoints
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
MUMBAI_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com

# API keys
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key

# Authorized addresses
AUTHORIZED_MINTERS=0x123...,0x456...
ADMIN_WALLETS=0x789...
```

## Script Development

When creating new scripts:

1. **Shell Scripts**: Add shebang `#!/bin/bash` and make executable with `chmod +x`
2. **JavaScript Scripts**: Use Hardhat runtime environment with `const hre = require("hardhat")`
3. **TypeScript Scripts**: Use tsx runner and proper type imports
4. **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling and exit codes
5. **Logging**: Use colored output for better visibility (chalk for JS, ANSI colors for bash)

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Contract Not Found
Ensure contracts are compiled:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Network Connection Issues
Check RPC endpoints in .env file and network connectivity.

## Security Notes

- **NEVER** commit private keys to version control
- Use hardware wallets for mainnet deployments
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
- Keep deployment artifacts secure
- Regularly audit role assignments
